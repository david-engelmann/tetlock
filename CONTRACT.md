# wallofwrong Contract, stub

The full Contract is the first build act of this repo phase. This
stub records the obligations the setup already knows it owes. Each
obligation becomes executable before any feature code that depends
on it lands.

- WW-1. Before anything irreversible runs, the agent states in one sentence what it believes is about to happen, and the operator approves the sentence.
- WW-2. Confessions are onrecord claims with due dates. The wall is a view over the record, never a second store.
- WW-3. Every confession is graded against what actually happened, and false confessions stay on the wall.
- WW-4. Wallofwrong grades predictions, onrecord keeps memories.

## Round 1. Confessions, outcomes, and the wall as a view (WW-5 to WW-12)

Contract preparation only in this pass. The build opens
when this repo's turn in the line's build order arrives,
after onrecord, whose record format this round consumes
at the version the onrecord contract states.

- WW-5. A confession is an onrecord claim in the OR-5
  shape: the claim text is the confession sentence, the
  subject key names the action it predicts, a due date
  states when the outcome should be known, and the
  evidence names the approval the stub's WW-1 requires.
  The sentence rule is mechanical: one line, ending in a
  period, with no internal sentence break. A text that
  breaks the rule is refused by name. Test,
  tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-6. Confessions and outcomes live only in the
  onrecord record file, appended under its rules. This
  repo keeps no store of its own; the ledger and the wall
  are views computed from the record on every run.
  Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-7. An outcome is a claim whose subject names the
  confession it grades, carrying a grade from a fixed set
  (held, broke, unverifiable) and the evidence of what
  actually happened. An outcome naming an unknown
  confession is refused by name. A confession is graded
  once; a correction arrives as a superseding outcome
  claim, never an edit. In Round 1 the grade is supplied
  by the grader, human or operator tooling; classifying
  what kind of wrong a broke confession was is the
  decision-model work of a later round, and nothing here
  guesses at it. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-8. The ledger view lists every confession with its
  state: graded with its grade, awaiting outcome, or
  overdue when its due date has passed ungraded, with the
  current time supplied by the caller so the view is
  reproducible. Nothing is dropped from the ledger.
  Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-9. The wall view renders one ISO week: the broke
  confessions whose outcomes landed that week, each with
  its sentence and what actually happened, then the
  overdue ungraded confessions of the week as their own
  list, named ungraded. Held and unverifiable
  confessions do not appear on the wall. Test,
  tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-10. A confession whose chain was superseded before
  its outcome (the plan changed) is shown in the ledger
  as superseded and never reaches the wall; grading a
  superseded confession is refused by name. Test,
  tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-11. Both views are deterministic: the same record
  and the same stated time produce byte-identical
  output. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-12. Appends follow the record's atomic append rule;
  rendered views go to stdout or a named path, written
  atomically, and every failure is a named error with
  exit 1. Test, tests/test_wall.py.

## Round 1 amendments, the pinned shapes (recorded before code)

- WW-5a. A confession claim carries the extra field
  kind with the value confession. Its evidence holds
  at least one entry whose source is approval, naming
  the WW-1 approval in its reference. The sentence
  rule, mechanical: the text is one line, ends in a
  period, and holds no other sentence terminator
  (period, question mark, exclamation mark) anywhere
  before that final period. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-6a. The record is consumed at onrecord's pinned
  discipline: the same shape checks, the same id
  derivation under canonical form 1, the same append
  rule. A defective record is refused with its defects
  named. A fixture record minted by onrecord's own
  store pins the agreement. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-7a. An outcome claim carries kind with the value
  outcome, the field grade with a value from the set,
  and a subject of the word confession, a colon, and
  the confession's claim id. Its text states what
  actually happened. Grading a confession with a live
  outcome is refused; a correction supersedes that
  outcome claim. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-8a. The ledger document lists confessions in
  record order, each with id, action, sentence, due,
  state (graded, awaiting, overdue, superseded), and
  its grade or null. Overdue is judged against the
  caller-supplied current time: an ungraded,
  unsuperseded confession whose due date is before
  the current date. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-9a. The wall is selected by a caller-supplied
  date; its week is that date's ISO week. The broke
  list holds confessions whose live outcome grades
  broke and whose outcome was asserted in the week,
  each with action, sentence, and the outcome's text
  as what happened. The ungraded list holds
  confessions due in the week with no live outcome
  and no supersession. Test, tests/test_wall.py.

## Round 1 amendments, after the reviews (recorded before the repair code)

- WW-5b. A sentence must hold content: the text
  before the final period contains at least one letter
  or digit. A bare period is refused as empty.
  Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-7b. Only outcome claims advance an outcome
  chain. An outcome superseded by a plain claim still
  governs. When more than one live outcome stands on
  a confession, or a live outcome carries a grade
  outside the fixed set, the views refuse, naming the
  confession and the outcomes: graded once is the
  model, and a record outside it is not silently
  resolved. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-8b. A confession graded before it was superseded
  keeps its graded state and its grade; superseded is
  the state only of a confession superseded while
  ungraded. A confession claim failing WW-5 (no
  approval evidence, no subject, no due date) is
  named in the ledger document's malformed list with
  its reasons and never reaches the wall; grading one
  is refused by name. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-9b. Dates are read in UTC: a timestamp carrying
  an offset is converted before its date is taken, so
  the same instant lands in the same week however it
  is written. The wall's broke entries also carry the
  outcome's claim id under outcome, naming the
  receipt. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
