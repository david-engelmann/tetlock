# wallofwrong Contract, stub

The full Contract is the first build act of this repo phase. This
stub records the obligations the setup already knows it owes. Each
obligation becomes executable before any feature code that depends
on it lands.

- WW-1. Before anything irreversible runs, the agent states in one sentence what it believes is about to happen, and the operator approves the sentence.
- WW-2. Confessions are onrecord claims with due dates. The wall is a view over the record, never a second store.
- WW-3. Every confession is graded against what actually happened, and false confessions stay on the wall.
- WW-4. Wallofwrong grades predictions, onrecord keeps memories.

## Round 1. Confessions, outcomes, and the wall as a view (WW-5 to WW-12)

Built in Round 1, after onrecord, whose record format
this round consumes at its pinned discipline. The
round also added the amendments below (WW-5a to WW-9a
before code, WW-5b, WW-7b, WW-8b, and WW-9b after the
reviews, before the repair code).

- WW-5. A confession is an onrecord claim in the OR-5
  shape: the claim text is the confession sentence, the
  subject key names the action it predicts, a due date
  states when the outcome should be known, and the
  evidence names the approval the stub's WW-1 requires.
  The sentence rule is mechanical: one line, ending in a
  period, with no internal sentence break. A text that
  breaks the rule is refused by name. Test,
  tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-6. Confessions and outcomes live only in the
  onrecord record file, appended under its rules. This
  repo keeps no store of its own; the ledger and the wall
  are views computed from the record on every run.
  Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-7. An outcome is a claim whose subject names the
  confession it grades, carrying a grade from a fixed set
  (held, broke, unverifiable) and the evidence of what
  actually happened. An outcome naming an unknown
  confession is refused by name. A confession is graded
  once; a correction arrives as a superseding outcome
  claim, never an edit. In Round 1 the grade is supplied
  by the grader, human or operator tooling; classifying
  what kind of wrong a broke confession was is the
  decision-model work of a later round, and nothing here
  guesses at it. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-8. The ledger view lists every confession with its
  state: graded with its grade, awaiting outcome, or
  overdue when its due date has passed ungraded, with the
  current time supplied by the caller so the view is
  reproducible. Nothing is dropped from the ledger.
  Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-9. The wall view renders one ISO week: the broke
  confessions whose outcomes landed that week, each with
  its sentence and what actually happened, then the
  overdue ungraded confessions of the week as their own
  list, named ungraded. Held and unverifiable
  confessions do not appear on the wall. Test,
  tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-10. A confession whose chain was superseded before
  its outcome (the plan changed) is shown in the ledger
  as superseded and never reaches the wall; grading a
  superseded confession is refused by name. Test,
  tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-11. Both views are deterministic: the same record
  and the same stated time produce byte-identical
  output. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-12. Appends follow the record's atomic append rule;
  rendered views go to stdout or a named path, written
  atomically, and every failure is a named error with
  exit 1. Test, tests/test_wall.py.

## Round 1 amendments, the pinned shapes (recorded before code)

- WW-5a. A confession claim carries the extra field
  kind with the value confession. Its evidence holds
  at least one entry whose source is approval, naming
  the WW-1 approval in its reference. The sentence
  rule, mechanical: the text is one line, ends in a
  period, and holds no other sentence terminator
  (period, question mark, exclamation mark) anywhere
  before that final period. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-6a. The record is consumed at onrecord's pinned
  discipline: the same shape checks, the same id
  derivation under canonical form 1, the same append
  rule. A defective record is refused with its defects
  named. A fixture record minted by onrecord's own
  store pins the agreement. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-7a. An outcome claim carries kind with the value
  outcome, the field grade with a value from the set,
  and a subject of the word confession, a colon, and
  the confession's claim id. Its text states what
  actually happened. Grading a confession with a live
  outcome is refused; a correction supersedes that
  outcome claim. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-8a. The ledger document lists confessions in
  record order, each with id, action, sentence, due,
  state (graded, awaiting, overdue, superseded), and
  its grade or null. Overdue is judged against the
  caller-supplied current time: an ungraded,
  unsuperseded confession whose due date is before
  the current date. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-9a. The wall is selected by a caller-supplied
  date; its week is that date's ISO week. The broke
  list holds confessions whose live outcome grades
  broke and whose outcome was asserted in the week,
  each with action, sentence, and the outcome's text
  as what happened. The ungraded list holds
  confessions due in the week with no live outcome
  and no supersession. Test, tests/test_wall.py.

## Round 1 amendments, after the reviews (recorded before the repair code)

- WW-5b. A sentence must hold content: the text
  before the final period contains at least one letter
  or digit. A bare period is refused as empty.
  Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-7b. Only outcome claims advance an outcome
  chain. An outcome superseded by a plain claim still
  governs. When more than one live outcome stands on
  a confession, or a live outcome carries a grade
  outside the fixed set, the views refuse, naming the
  confession and the outcomes: graded once is the
  model, and a record outside it is not silently
  resolved. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-8b. A confession graded before it was superseded
  keeps its graded state and its grade; superseded is
  the state only of a confession superseded while
  ungraded. A confession claim failing WW-5 (no
  approval evidence, no subject, no due date) is
  named in the ledger document's malformed list with
  its reasons and never reaches the wall; grading one
  is refused by name. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-9b. Dates are read in UTC: a timestamp carrying
  an offset is converted before its date is taken, so
  the same instant lands in the same week however it
  is written. The wall's broke entries also carry the
  outcome's claim id under outcome, naming the
  receipt. Test, tests/test_wall.py.

## Round 2. The tally (WW-13 to WW-16)

- WW-13. A third view, the tally: over the whole
  record at a caller-supplied now, an ISO timestamp
  read in UTC as the ledger reads it, the counts of
  the well-formed confessions by state (graded,
  awaiting, overdue, superseded) and, among the
  graded, by grade (held, broke, unverifiable).
  Counts ride with their denominators in the document
  itself, never as a bare rate: the state counts
  under the confessions total, the grade counts
  under the graded count. Every named count is
  always present, zero included, so the table can
  be checked by addition. Test, tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-14. The arithmetic closes. The state counts sum
  to the confessions total; the grade counts sum to
  the graded count. Malformed confessions (WW-8b)
  are excluded from every count above and reported
  as their own single count. Test,
  tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-15. Per action: one row for each action holding
  at least one graded well-formed confession, naming
  the action, its graded count, and its counts by
  grade, rows ordered by action name, and the rows'
  grade counts sum to the document's. An action with
  no graded confession earns no row; its confessions
  still count in the state totals. Test,
  tests/test_wall.py.
- WW-16. The tally stands on the ledger's own
  classification: the same states, the same outcome
  index, the same refusals, a missing record refused
  by name. The ledger and wall documents do not
  change. The command is tally, with the record, a
  required now, and the views' output discipline
  (WW-12). Test, tests/test_wall.py.

## Round 2 post-review amendments, recorded before the repairs

- WW-8c. The malformed test of WW-8b is the whole of
  WW-5. A confession claim whose text breaks the
  sentence rule is malformed, and a subject that is
  empty or all whitespace names no action and is
  malformed. Round 1 checked only approval, subject
  presence, and due date, so a forged confession with
  a two-sentence text stood as well-formed in every
  view and could be graded; the reviews drove it
  through the tally and the ledger alike. Every view
  and the grading path read the one definition, so
  the repair lands in the definition. Test,
  tests/test_wall.py.
